This project is a browser-based workspace for crafting video LLM prompts while steadily tracking the entire storyline of your production. It was built to make it easy to manage prompts, starter/ending images, translations, and project notes in one place and to carry that context across machines.

## Recent update — 3 November 2025

This release adds three user-facing features and several quality-of-life improvements:

- Copy scenes: copy a scene within the same timeline or copy it to another project. This preserves the scene image, prompts and translations.
- Project operations: duplicate a full project or permanently delete a project from the explorer.
- Presentation mode: open the current project in a fullscreen/preview presentation for reviewing the story as a sequence of large images and prompts.

Previous published version: 29 November 2025



- Copy scenes dialog:

- Presentation mode preview:

How to use the new features (short):

- Copy a scene: open the scene menu (clipboard icon) and choose "Copy scene". Select target project (or choose the same project) and click "Duplicate in this project" or "Copy to project".
- Duplicate/delete project: in the project header use the "Duplicate project" or "Delete project" buttons. Deleting asks for confirmation.
- Presentation mode: click the "Presentation" button in the project header to enter fullscreen review mode. Use keyboard arrows to move between scenes.

These notes are also reflected in the Dutch README (`README.nl.md`).

## Why this tool?

I first created this editor as a handy companion while producing video prompts for generative models. I wanted a smooth way to:

- Keep start and end reference images together with the text prompts.
- See the entire storyline from scene to scene without losing the big picture.
- Store English prompts alongside Dutch translations for quick hand-off or localisation.
- Export image sequences and prompt scripts per project so nothing gets lost.

## Highlights

- **Project explorer** – create, open, and sort storyline projects with automatic last-modified tracking.
- **Scene board** – drag scenes horizontally, reorder via drag handles, edit prompts in-place, or open a fullscreen dialog for focused editing.
- **Image workflow** – drop or upload images per scene, export all images as numbered files, and preview large versions instantly.
- **Prompt exports** – review prompts in a dialog, copy them to the clipboard, and save a text file in the project folder in one step.
- **Browser storage** – remembers your chosen project directory between sessions (using the browser’s File System Access API).
- **Bilingual UI** – switch between Dutch and English labels from the header.
- **Portable by design** – everything lives inside a single `storylineprompteditor` folder that you can copy to another machine.

└─ README.nl.md              # Dutch documentation
```

## Getting started

1. **Install requirements**  
   You only need Python 3 (or any static file server). Nothing else is required.

2. **Launch the local server**

   ```bash
   ./server.sh start
   ```

   - Default address: `http://localhost:8123/opdracht/storylineprompteditor/`
   - `./server.sh status` shows the running PID.
   - `./server.sh stop` terminates the server.

3. **Open the editor**  
   Use Chrome or Edge. Click “📁 Choose project folder” and select a writable directory. The tool will create:
   - `projecten/` containing JSON data + images per project
   - `index.json` with the global project list

4. **Create or open projects**  
   Once a root folder is selected, you can add projects, manage scenes, upload images, and export prompts.

## Browser support

- Requires a secure context (`http://localhost`) and the File System Access API.  
- Chrome ≥ 86 and Edge (Chromium) are supported. Safari/Firefox currently lack the APIs needed for full functionality.

## Contributing & notes

- No build step is required; everything is native HTML/CSS/JS.
- If you copy this folder to another machine, just run `./server.sh start` and continue working.
- Feel free to extend `assets/js/translations.js` with additional languages or tweak styles in `assets/css/style.css`.
